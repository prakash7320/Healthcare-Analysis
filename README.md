# 🏥 Healthcare Appointment No-Show Prediction & Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
Missed medical appointments (No-Shows) are a major challenge for healthcare organizations, leading to inefficient resource utilization and increased operational costs.

This project analyzes healthcare appointment data to identify no-show patterns, predict patient behavior using machine learning, and visualize insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze factors influencing appointment no-shows  
- Predict patient no-show probability using machine learning  
- Visualize trends using Power BI  
- Provide actionable optimization recommendations  

---

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains historical healthcare appointment records with the following features:

- Age  
- Gender  
- SMS Reminder Received  
- Appointment Weekday  
- No-Show Status  
  - `0` → Attended  
  - `1` → No-Show  

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
- Machine Learning (Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- Power BI
- chat gpt
- GitHub

---

## 🔄 Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- Handled missing and inconsistent data  
- Encoded categorical variables  
- Created new features:
  - Age Groups  
  - Weekday column  
- Converted target variable for model training  

---

## 📊 Trend Analysis
The following trends were analyzed:

### 📱 SMS Reminder
Patients who received SMS reminders showed a lower no-show rate.

### 👥 Age Group
Certain age groups demonstrated higher no-show behavior.

### 📅 Weekday
No-show rates varied across different weekdays.
